The final design of our rover is pictured above with its SolidWorks design pictured below. It includes the steering system, the drive train, and the electronics all connected by a wooden chassis. The steering system is at the front of the rover. It controls the direction that the front wheels are pointing by turning a servo motor. The drive train is in the back and controls the direction and the speed of the back wheels.
The gray parts in the middle of the steering system and rear axle are the electronics. The battery is placed in the middle because it is the heaviest part. This keeps the center of gravity close to the middle of the rover, lowering the chances of the rover tipping over or being unstable. The battery is attached to the chassis via velcro straps that go through holes cutout in the chassis. The buck converter is attached to the chassis with 2 M3 screws. The other electronics, including the ESC, On/Off switch, and receiver are attached to the chassis with double sided tape. Each of the parts are strategically placed to be near the other parts that they are plugged into. This keeps the wires neat in the final design.

We chose to use 85 mm wheels, as they were the largest available wheels for this project. The large wheels made traversing rough terrain and driving over the peak of the ramp easier. The overall dimensions for the entire rover came out to be 13.94 inches by 9.43 inches, which fits the requirements that the size needs to be within 16 inches by 10 inches.

For the steering system, we decided to 3D print the majority of the parts. The servo motor is attached to the chassis with 4 M3 screws, and goes through a hole in the chassis to hold it lower. Connected to the servo motor is a 3D-printed adaptor (pictured above) that screws into the servo motor and attaches to two rotating rods on the other end. This piece holds the rods farther away from the axis of rotation, therefore compounding the amount of linear motion when the servo rotates. Those two rods are each connected with M3 screws to a rotating part that holds the 2-inch D shafts, which connect to the wheels. These rotating parts are held up by connectors (tan pieces) that allow them to rotate and secure them to the chassis. In total, including the wheels, the width of the steering system is 9.4 inches, which is within the maximum of 10 inches.
The drive train of our rover is in the back. This system is quite simple in that it just secures the 8-inch D shaft to the chassis and connects it via a gear train to the motor. The D shaft is held up using wooden cutouts. They are glued to the chassis, and have other wooden cutouts glued on top of them to reinforce them. This is because these connections hold up the weight of the rover. The D shaft is below the chassis to raise the rover as high as possible. This raises the center of gravity, but it allows the rover to go over the ramp on the obstacle course. There is a cutout in the wooden chassis to allow the gear to spin and connect to the motor, which is screwed into the chassis using the motor mount. The transparent red piece in the image is a 3D printed gear guard that connects to the chassis with M3 screws. The gear guard is put over the gear to protect any foreign objects from interfering with the gear and the motor.
